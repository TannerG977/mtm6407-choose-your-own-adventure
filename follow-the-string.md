# The Hot Dog on a String
You find yourself walking a park late at night. As you roam you catch the aroma of something that smells delicious. <br>
You see it sitting on a picnic bench an untouched steaming hot dog. Only one problem, the hot dog appears to be attached to a string. <br>
What will you do?

### Follow the string

You follow the string to a dense bush, cautiously unveiling secrets in the quiet night. <br>
There, a faint figure emergesâ€”an old lady holding the string. <br>
Spotting you, he signals to be quiet and whispers, "My dog escaped. I'm luring him back with his favorite food."
