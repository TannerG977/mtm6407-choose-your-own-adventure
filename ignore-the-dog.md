You decide it's best to ignore such a suspicious hotdog on a string. You go home and go to sleep. 

You are suddenly jolted awake when someone enters your room. It's a 6'6" man wearing a hotdog costume. He asks "My dogs aren't good enough for you?".

He throws a box of 600 frozen hotdogs at your head.
